# Guidelines

To contribute code changes or update the documentation, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the upstream repository and clone the fork locally.
2. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and install the project's dependencies
   with `poetry install --extras full`.
3. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and install the hooks by running `pre-commit install` in the
   repository's hook.
4. Make whatever changes and additions you wish and commit these - please try to keep your commit history clean.
5. Create a pull request to the main repository with an explanation of your changes. The PR should detail the
   contribution and link to any related issues - if existing.
